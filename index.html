				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p>Rotaract is a non-profit service club for students and young professionals ages 18 to 30. Rotaract clubs are either community or university based, and they're sponsored by a local Rotary club. There are more than 8,200 Rotaract clubs in about 170 countries and this is ever increasing as Rotaract has become a worldwide phenomenon. The Burlington chapter of Rotaract was founded in February 2011.</p>
